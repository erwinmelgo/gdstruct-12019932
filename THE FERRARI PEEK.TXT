1. Initialize endpoint and startpoint
2. Start for loop to iterate the array where i is 1 since there is already a startPoint
3. If the startPoint is equal to the value that is being searched, return startPoint
4. Same happens with the endPoint
5. Otherwise, the next index will be set as the start point and the second to the last index will be the end point.
6. Repeat loop until the value is found
7. If value is not found, return -1
